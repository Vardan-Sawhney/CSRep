# Color Switch Replica
Colour Switch Replica - personal interests in game dev, simply starting off here

Everything was made using Unity
Note: Sometimes colours don't switch, simply because of random generation based off the 4 colours, and there's no failure if the ball drops below the screen like the real game.
